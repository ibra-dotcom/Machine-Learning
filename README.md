BUILDING A MODEL IN PYTHON
Weâ€™re now ready to design a full machine learning model building on the code
We will design a house price valuation system using gradient
boosting following these six steps:
1) Import libraries
2) Import dataset
3) Scrub dataset
4) Split data into training and test data
5) Select an algorithm and configure its hyperparameters
6) Evaluate the results
